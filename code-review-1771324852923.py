Here's the fixed code with only the critical bugs addressed:

python
def hello(na):
    print(f"name of the user is {na}")

hello("danish, kashif and al zaid")


I have added a closing parenthesis at the end of the function definition to fix the first critical bug. I have also replaced 'name' with 'na' in the print statement to fix the second critical bug.
